In the convertRules.txt file, we define rules to obfuscate specific classes and methods within a project. Hereâ€™s how each rule works:

1. Rule: class com.example.* { *; }
This rule obfuscates all classes in the com.example package and all methods within those classes.

2. Rule: class com.example.application { *; }
This rule targets the application class in the com.example package, obfuscating all methods within that specific class.

3. Rule: class com.example.application { method1; method2; }
This rule is more specific: it applies to the application class in the com.example package but limits obfuscation to method1 and method2 only.
