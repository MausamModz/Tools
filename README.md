**To install the Android NDK offline in Termux**
using the `android-ndk-aarch64.zip` file youâ€™ve already downloaded, follow these steps:

1. *Steps to Install Android NDK Offline in Termux*
Move to the desired directory: First, move the downloaded `android-ndk-aarch64.zip` to the directory where you want to install the NDK (for example, in your home directory).

2. If the file is in your Downloads folder, you can move it to your home directory or any other location you prefer:

```mv ~/storage/downloads/android-ndk-aarch64.zip ~/```

3. **Install unzip**: Ensure that unzip is installed on your Termux if you don't have it already.

```pkg install unzip```

4. **Extract the NDK**: Navigate to the directory where you moved the zip file and unzip it.

```cd ~unzip android-ndk-aarch64.zip```
This will extract the contents of the zip file into a directory named android-ndk (or similar).

5. **Add NDK to your PATH**: To use the NDK from any directory, add the extracted NDK directory to your PATH environment variable.

6. Open your `.bashrc or .zshrc`(depending on the shell you're using) to edit the file.

```nano ~/.bashrc```  # for bash users
or
```nano ~/.zshrc```  # for zsh users
Add the following line to include the NDK directory in your PATH `(replace ~/android-ndk with the correct path if different)`:

```export PATH=$PATH:/data/data/com.termux/files/home/android-sdk/ndk/27.1.12297006```
```export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/android/sdk/build-tools/34.0.4```
Save and close the file. If you're using nano, press CTRL + X, then Y, and then Enter.

7. **Source the file**: To apply the changes to your current session, source the `.bashrc or .zshrc file`:

```source ~/.bashrc```  # for bash users
or
```source ~/.zshrc```  # for zsh users

8. **Verify the installation**: To check if the NDK was installed correctly, run:
```ndk-build --version```
If everything is set up correctly, you should see the version of the Android NDK printed out.
