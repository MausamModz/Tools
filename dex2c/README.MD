<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
# Usage

### Filters

Add all your filters in `filter.txt` file - one rule for each line. Filters are made using regex patterns. There are two types of filters available in **Dex2c** - whitelist, and blacklist. You can use them whenever you need them.

#### WhiteList

- Protect just one method in a specific class.
```
com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Protect all methods in a specific class.
```
com/some/class;.*
```

- Protect all methods in all classes under a package path.
```
com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Protect a method with the name onCreate in all classes.
```
.*;onCreate\(.*
```

#### BlackList

Adding an exclamation `!` sign before a rule will mark that rule as a blacklist.

- Exclude one method in a specific class from being protected.
```
!com/some/class;some_method(some_parameters)return_type
```

- Exclude all methods in a specific class from being protected.
```
!com/some/class;.*
```

- Exclude all methods in all classes under a package path from being protected.
```
!com/some/package/.*;.*
```

- Exclude a method with the name onCreate in all classes from being protected.
```
!.*;onCreate\(.*
```


### Protect apps

- Copy your apk file to `dex2c` folder where `dcc.py` is located and run this command.

```bash
python3 dcc.py -a input.apk -o output.apk
```

- Run this command to know about all the other options available in dcc to find the best ones for your needs.

```bash
python3 dcc.py --help
```


<!-- CHANGE LIB NAME -->
# How to change lib name

Open `project/jni/Android.mk` file in the cloned directory. You will find a variable named `LOCAL_MODULE`, initially with the value `stub`. Please change it to your desired lib name. Keep in mind the following instructions to prevent possible errors.
- Don't use spaces in lib name, use hyphen `-` or underscore `_`
- Don't use any kind of symbols or punctuations in lib name other than underscores and hyphens
- Don't start the lib name with the text `lib` itself
